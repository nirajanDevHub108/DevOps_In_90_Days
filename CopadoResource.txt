Things we have to note when we want to setup Copado in salesforce organization

1.make sure we have correct salesforce organization edition to install salesforce org

2.we can install latest version copado from success community .

3.Copado is a salesforce managed package and we only need to install in one Org, which will act as governance org. Copado will connect with other salesforce org using OAuth authentication access method

4.we have to provide  salesforce login detail for governance Org ,then from the security options we have to choose  Install for Admins only  and then approve third party access later we will provide access to package components to others.
5. After installation is done  under setup-> installed package -> check Copado Package

6.After deployment Register copado application in Copado server you can do by Navigating to Account Summary page and click Register application to finish registration process.

7.you can also white list Ip address so that you can create  list of trusted Ip addresses to access copado backend
     
               Setup -> Network access 
Note if  there is an Ip restrictions at the profile level we also needs to add these addresses in Login Ip Range section of profile

8. In Setup-> session settings to ensure enforce login ip is disabled
